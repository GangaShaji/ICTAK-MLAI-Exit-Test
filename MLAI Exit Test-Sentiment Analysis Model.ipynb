Maybe i just want to get a certain insight into this guy who i thought was really cool in the eighties just to maybe make up my mind whether he is guilty or innocent. Moonwalker is part biography, part feature film which i remember going to see at the cinema when it was originally released. Some of it has subtle messages about MJ's feeling towards the press and also the obvious message of drugs are bad m'kay.<br /><br />Visually impressive but of course this is all about Michael Jackson so unless you remotely like MJ in anyway then you are going to hate this and find it boring. Some may call MJ an egotist for consenting to the making of this movie BUT MJ and most of his fans would say that he made it for the fans which if true is really nice of him.<br /><br />The actual feature film bit when it finally starts is only on for 20 minutes or so excluding the Smooth Criminal sequence and Joe Pesci is convincing as a psychopathic all powerful drug lord. Why he wants MJ dead so bad is beyond me. Because MJ overheard his plans? Nah, Joe Pesci's character ranted that he wanted people to know it is he who is supplying drugs etc so i dunno, maybe he just hates MJ's music.<br /><br />Lots of cool things in this like MJ turning into a car and a robot and the whole Speed Demon sequence. Also, the director must have had the patience of a saint when it came to filming the kiddy Bad sequence as usually directors hate working with one kid let alone a whole bunch of them performing a complex dance scene.<br /><br />Bottom line, this movie is for people who like MJ on one level or another (which i think is most people). If not, then stay away. It does try and give off a wholesome message and ironically MJ's bestest buddy in this movie is a girl! Michael Jackson is truly one of the most talented people ever to grace this planet but is he guilty?

G. Wells' classic book. Mr. Hines succeeds in doing so. I, and those who watched his film with me, appreciated the fact that it was not the standard, predictable Hollywood fare that comes out every year, e.g. the Spielberg version with Tom Cruise that had only the slightest resemblance to the book. Obviously, everyone looks for different things in a movie. Those who envision themselves as amateur \\\"critics\\\" look only to criticize everything they can. Others rate a movie on more important bases,like being entertained, which is why most people never agree with the \\\"critics\\\". We enjoyed the effort Mr. Hines put into being faithful to H.G. Wells' classic novel, and we found it to be very entertaining. This made it easy to overlook what the \\\"critics\\\" perceive to be its shortcomings.\"  \n","2  The film starts with a manager (Nicholas Bell) giving welcome investors (Robert Carradine) to Primal Park . A secret project mutating a primal animal using fossilized DNA, like ¨Jurassik Park¨, and some scientists resurrect one of nature's most fearsome predators, the Sabretooth tiger or Smilodon . Scientific ambition turns deadly, however, and when the high voltage fence is opened the creature escape and begins savagely stalking its prey - the human visitors , tourists and scientific.Meanwhile some youngsters enter in the restricted area of the security center and are attacked by a pack of large pre-historical animals which are deadlier and bigger . In addition , a security agent (Stacy Haiduk) and her mate (Brian Wimmer) fight hardly against the carnivorous Smilodons. The Sabretooths, themselves , of course, are the real star stars and they are astounding terrifyingly though not convincing. The giant animals savagely are stalking its prey and the group run afoul and fight against one nature's most fearsome predators. Furthermore a third Sabretooth more dangerous and slow stalks its victims.<br /><br />The movie delivers the goods with lots of blood and gore as beheading, hair-raising chills,full of scares when the Sabretooths appear with mediocre special effects.The story provides exciting and stirring entertainment but it results to be quite boring .The giant animals are majority made by computer generator and seem totally lousy .Middling performances though the players reacting appropriately to becoming food.Actors give vigorously physical performances dodging the beasts ,running,bound and leaps or dangling over walls . And it packs a ridiculous final deadly scene. No for small kids by realistic,gory and violent attack scenes . Other films about Sabretooths or Smilodon are the following : ¨Sabretooth(2002)¨by James R Hickox with Vanessa Angel, David Keith and John Rhys Davies and the much better ¨10.000 BC(2006)¨ by Roland Emmerich with with Steven Strait, Cliff Curtis and Camilla Belle. This motion picture filled with bloody moments is badly directed by George Miller and with no originality because takes too many elements from previous films. Miller is an Australian director usually working for television (Tidal wave, Journey to the center of the earth, and many others) and occasionally for cinema ( The man from Snowy river, Zeus and Roxanne,Robinson Crusoe ). Rating : Below average, bottom of barrel.  \n","3                                                                                                                                                                                                              It must be assumed that those who praised this film (\\the greatest filmed opera ever,\\\" didn't I read somewhere?) either don't care for opera, don't care for Wagner, or don't care about anything except their desire to appear Cultured. Either as a representation of Wagner's swan-song, or as a movie, this strikes me as an unmitigated disaster, with a leaden reading of the score matched to a tricksy, lugubrious realisation of the text.<br /><br />It's questionable that people with ideas as to what an opera (or, for that matter, a play, especially one by Shakespeare) is \\\"about\\\" should be allowed anywhere near a theatre or film studio; Syberberg, very fashionably, but without the smallest justification from Wagner's text, decided that Parsifal is \\\"about\\\" bisexual integration, so that the title character, in the latter stages, transmutes into a kind of beatnik babe, though one who continues to sing high tenor -- few if any of the actors in the film are the singers, and we get a double dose of Armin Jordan, the conductor, who is seen as the face (but not heard as the voice) of Amfortas, and also appears monstrously in double exposure as a kind of Batonzilla or Conductor Who Ate Monsalvat during the playing of the Good Friday music -- in which, by the way, the transcendant loveliness of nature is represented by a scattering of shopworn and flaccid crocuses stuck in ill-laid turf, an expedient which baffles me. In the theatre we sometimes have to piece out such imperfections with our thoughts, but I can't think why Syberberg couldn't splice in, for Parsifal and Gurnemanz, mountain pasture as lush as was provided for Julie Andrews in Sound of Music...<br /><br />The sound is hard to endure, the high voices and the trumpets in particular possessing an aural glare that adds another sort of fatigue to our impatience with the uninspired conducting and paralytic unfolding of the ritual. Someone in another review mentioned the 1951 Bayreuth recording, and Knappertsbusch, though his tempi are often very slow, had what Jordan altogether lacks, a sense of pulse, a feeling for the ebb and flow of the music -- and, after half a century, the orchestral sound in that set, in modern pressings, is still superior to this film.\"  \n","4                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Superbly trashy and wondrously unpretentious 80's exploitation, hooray! The pre-credits opening sequences somewhat give the false impression that we're dealing with a serious and harrowing drama, but you need not fear because barely ten minutes later we're up until our necks in nonsensical chainsaw battles, rough fist-fights, lurid dialogs and gratuitous nudity! Bo and Ingrid are two orphaned siblings with an unusually close and even slightly perverted relationship. Can you imagine playfully ripping off the towel that covers your sister's naked body and then stare at her unshaven genitals for several whole minutes? Well, Bo does that to his sister and, judging by her dubbed laughter, she doesn't mind at all. Sick, dude! Anyway, as kids they fled from Russia with their parents, but nasty soldiers brutally slaughtered mommy and daddy. A friendly smuggler took custody over them, however, and even raised and trained Bo and Ingrid into expert smugglers. When the actual plot lifts off, 20 years later, they're facing their ultimate quest as the mythical and incredibly valuable White Fire diamond is coincidentally found in a mine. Very few things in life ever made as little sense as the plot and narrative structure of \\White Fire\\\", but it sure is a lot of fun to watch. Most of the time you have no clue who's beating up who or for what cause (and I bet the actors understood even less) but whatever! The violence is magnificently grotesque and every single plot twist is pleasingly retarded. The script goes totally bonkers beyond repair when suddenly  and I won't reveal for what reason  Bo needs a replacement for Ingrid and Fred Williamson enters the scene with a big cigar in his mouth and his sleazy black fingers all over the local prostitutes. Bo's principal opponent is an Italian chick with big breasts but a hideous accent, the preposterous but catchy theme song plays at least a dozen times throughout the film, there's the obligatory \\\"we're-falling-in-love\\\" montage and loads of other attractions! My God, what a brilliant experience. The original French title translates itself as \\\"Life to Survive\\\", which is uniquely appropriate because it makes just as much sense as the rest of the movie: None!\"  "],"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-30a61beb-e39d-4cd3-9373-6a03784bb54b\" class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>id</th>\n","      <th>sentiment</th>\n","      <th>review</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>5814_8</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>With all this stuff going down at the moment with MJ i've started listening to his music, watching the odd documentary here and there, watched The Wiz and watched Moonwalker again. Maybe i just want to get a certain insight into this guy who i thought was really cool in the eighties just to maybe make up my mind whether he is guilty or innocent. Moonwalker is part biography, part feature film which i remember going to see at the cinema when it was originally released. Some of it has subtle messages about MJ's feeling towards the press and also the obvious message of drugs are bad m'kay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Visually impressive but of course this is all about Michael Jackson so unless you remotely like MJ in anyway then you are going to hate this and find it boring. Some may call MJ an egotist for consenting to the making of this movie BUT MJ and most of his fans would say that he made it for the fans which if true is really nice of him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual feature film bit when it finally starts is only on for 20 minutes or so excluding the Smooth Criminal sequence and Joe Pesci is convincing as a psychopathic all powerful drug lord. Why he wants MJ dead so bad is beyond me. Because MJ overheard his plans? Nah, Joe Pesci's character ranted that he wanted people to know it is he who is supplying drugs etc so i dunno, maybe he just hates MJ's music.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lots of cool things in this like MJ turning into a car and a robot and the whole Speed Demon sequence. Also, the director must have had the patience of a saint when it came to filming the kiddy Bad sequence as usually directors hate working with one kid let alone a whole bunch of them performing a complex dance scene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, this movie is for people who like MJ on one level or another (which i think is most people). If not, then stay away. It does try and give off a wholesome message and ironically MJ's bestest buddy in this movie is a girl! Michael Jackson is truly one of the most talented people ever to grace this planet but is he guilty? Well, with all the attention i've gave this subject....hmmm well i don't know because people can be different behind closed doors, i know this for a fact.

           With all this stuff going down at the moment with MJ ive started listening to his music watching the odd documentary here and there watched The Wiz and watched Moonwalker again Maybe i just want to get a certain insight into this guy who i thought was really cool in the eighties just to maybe make up my mind whether he is guilty or innocent Moonwalker is part biography part feature film which i remember going to see at the cinema when it was originally released Some of it has subtle messages about MJs feeling towards the press and also the obvious message of drugs are bad mkaybr br Visually impressive but of course this is all about Michael Jackson so unless you remotely like MJ in anyway then you are going to hate this and find it boring Some may call MJ an egotist for consenting to the making of this movie BUT MJ and most of his fans would say that he made it for the fans which if true is really nice of himbr br The actual feature film bit when it finally starts is only on for 20 minutes or so excluding the Smooth Criminal sequence and Joe Pesci is convincing as a psychopathic all powerful drug lord Why he wants MJ dead so bad is beyond me Because MJ overheard his plans Nah Joe Pescis character ranted that he wanted people to know it is he who is supplying drugs etc so i dunno maybe he just hates MJs musicbr br Lots of cool things in this like MJ turning into a car and a robot and the whole Speed Demon sequence Also the director must have had the patience of a saint when it came to filming the kiddy Bad sequence as usually directors hate working with one kid let alone a whole bunch of them performing a complex dance scenebr br Bottom line this movie is for people who like MJ on one level or another which i think is most people If not then stay away It does try and give off a wholesome message and ironically MJs bestest buddy in this movie is a girl Michael Jackson is truly one of the most talented people ever to grace this planet but is he guilty Well with all the attention ive gave this subjecthmmm well i dont know because people can be different behind closed doors i know this for a fact He is either an extremely nice but stupid guy or one of the most sickest liars I hope he is not the latter  \n","1

entertaining film that obviously goes to great effort and lengths to faithfully recreate H G Wells classic book Mr Hines succeeds in doing so I and those who watched his film with me appreciated the fact that it was not the standard predictable Hollywood fare that comes out every year eg the Spielberg version with Tom Cruise that had only the slightest resemblance to the book Obviously everyone looks for different things in a movie Those who envision themselves as amateur critics look only to criticize everything they can Others rate a movie on more important baseslike being entertained which is why most people never agree with the critics We enjoyed the effort Mr Hines put into being faithful to HG Wells classic novel and we found it to be very entertaining This made it easy to overlook what the critics perceive to be its shortcomings  \n","2      The film starts with a manager Nicholas Bell giving welcome investors Robert Carradine to Primal Park  A secret project mutating

restricted area of the security center and are attacked by a pack of large prehistorical animals which are deadlier and bigger  In addition  a security agent Stacy Haiduk and her mate Brian Wimmer fight hardly against the carnivorous Smilodons The Sabretooths themselves  of course are the real star stars and they are astounding terrifyingly though not convincing The giant animals savagely are stalking its prey and the group run afoul and fight against one natures most fearsome predators Furthermore a third Sabretooth more dangerous and slow stalks its victimsbr br The movie delivers the goods with lots of blood and gore as beheading hairraising chillsfull of scares when the Sabretooths appear with mediocre special effectsThe story provides exciting and stirring entertainment but it results to be quite boring The giant animals are majority made by computer generator and seem totally lousy Middling performances though the players reacting appropriately to becoming foodActors give vigorously physical performances dodging the beasts runningbound and leaps or dangling over walls  And it packs a ridiculous final deadly scene No for small kids by realisticgory and violent attack

ever didnt I read somewhere either dont care for opera dont care for Wagner or dont care about anything except their desire to appear Cultured Either as a representation of Wagners swansong or as a movie this strikes me as an unmitigated disaster with a leaden reading of the score matched to a tricksy lugubrious realisation of the textbr br Its questionable that people with ideas as to what an opera or for that matter a play especially one by Shakespeare is about should be allowed anywhere near a theatre or film studio Syberberg very fashionably but without the smallest justification from Wagners text decided that Parsifal is about bisexual integration so that the title character in the latter stages transmutes into a kind of beatnik babe though one who continues to sing high tenor  few if any of the actors in the film are the singers and we get a double dose of Armin Jordan the conductor who is seen as the face but not heard as the voice of Amfortas and also appears monstrously in double exposure as a kind of Batonzilla or Conductor Who Ate Monsalvat during the playing of the Good Friday music  in which by the way the transcendant loveliness of nature is represented by a scattering of shopworn and flaccid crocuses stuck in illlaid turf an expedient which baffles me In the theatre we sometimes have to piece out such imperfections with our thoughts but I cant think why Syberberg couldnt splice in for Parsifal and Gurnemanz mountain pasture as lush as was provided for Julie Andrews in Sound of Musicbr br The sound is hard to endure the high voices and the trumpets in particular possessing an aural glare that adds another sort of fatigue to our impatience with the uninspired conducting and paralytic unfolding of the ritual Someone in another review mentioned the 1951 Bayreuth recording and Knappertsbusch though his tempi are often very slow had what Jordan altogether lacks a sense of pulse a feeling for the ebb and flow of the music  and after half a century the orchestral sound in that set in modern pressings is still superior to this film  \n","4

sequences somewhat give the false impression that were dealing with a serious and harrowing drama but you need not fear because barely ten minutes later were up until our necks in nonsensical chainsaw battles rough fistfights lurid dialogs and gratuitous nudity Bo and Ingrid are two orphaned siblings with an unusually close and even slightly perverted relationship Can you imagine playfully ripping off the towel that covers your sisters naked body and then stare at her unshaven genitals for several whole minutes Well Bo does that to his sister and judging by her dubbed laughter she doesnt mind at all Sick dude Anyway as kids they fled from Russia with their parents but nasty soldiers brutally slaughtered mommy and daddy A friendly smuggler took custody over them however and even raised and trained Bo and Ingrid into expert smugglers When the actual plot lifts off 20 years later theyre facing their ultimate quest as the mythical and incredibly valuable White Fire diamond is coincidentally found in a mine Very few things in life ever made as little sense as the plot and narrative structure of White Fire but it sure is a lot of fun to watch Most of the time you have no clue whos beating up who or for what cause and I bet the actors understood even less but whatever The violence is magnificently grotesque and every single plot twist is pleasingly retarded The script goes totally bonkers beyond repair when suddenly  and I wont reveal for what reason  Bo needs a replacement for Ingrid and Fred Williamson enters the scene with a big cigar in his mouth and his sleazy black fingers all over the local prostitutes Bos principal opponent is an Italian chick with big breasts but a hideous accent the preposterous but catchy theme song plays at least a dozen times throughout the film theres the obligatory werefallinginlove montage and loads of other attractions My God what a brilliant experience The original French title translates itself as Life to Survive which is uniquely appropriate because it makes just as much sense as the rest of the movie None  \n","...

no need for a sequel certainly not after a television series that was already a sequel to the first film This film feels like a soapopera The writing is so bad its utterly simple The jokes dont come across the acting is flat its shot like a soap it lacks any direction The first film had a good emotional spine behind it Every character had a little arc It was very simple then but somehow it worked and I could see the merit of that film But this time around there is no cohesive storyline The characters are dull stereotypes and nothing interesting happens One good thing the Brazilian boy who plays Axel Daeseleires son is pretty well cast That was their one moment of creative success on this film I hear they already shot a second television series as a sequel to Team Spirit 2 but please God dont let them make a third feature installment  \n","24997

Adam Sandler part of his life And get out of the Adam Sandler plots There are two funny parts in the whole movie I couldnt even finish the last 5 minutes I was getting bored The Animal is an alright film I do usually enjoy Adam Sandler films that have the same plot But this was trying too hard to impress The jokes are very old So trust me This is not a film that most people could really get into

regions is in my opinion one of his weakest films First lets admit that 70 years later Spain is much richer than it was then and when I say this I fully admit that wealth can bring problems of its own like excessive individualism and consumerism though all in all wealth its a far better condition than the extreme poverty portrayed here And if poverty receded in Spain it was not exactly with the sort of socialism that Buñuel favored but with Western European style capitalism But one of the most shocking things about the movie is this in one scene the narrator chides that in school children are taught the value of Pi Teaching math to poor people the horror Buñuel shortsightedness is at its most glaring here not realizing that it is access to the latest knowledge and technology what will help the poor overcome their situation What is he proposing That children are taught exactly what at school Doesnt Buñuel understand that it is the lack of modern technology that has made them poor in

going down at the moment with MJ ive started listening to his music watching the odd documentary here and there watched The Wiz and watched Moonwalker again Maybe i just want to get a certain insight into this guy who i thought was really cool in the eighties just to maybe make up my mind whether he is guilty or innocent Moonwalker is part biography part feature film which i remember going to see at the cinema when it was originally released Some of it has subtle messages about MJs feeling towards the press and also the obvious message of drugs are bad mkaybr br Visually impressive but of course this is all about Michael Jackson so unless you remotely like MJ in anyway then you are going to hate this and find it boring Some may call MJ an egotist for consenting to the making of this movie BUT MJ and most of his fans would say that he made it for the fans which if true is really nice of himbr br The actual feature film bit when it finally starts is only on for 20 minutes or so excluding the Smooth Criminal sequence and Joe Pesci is convincing as a psychopathic all powerful drug lord Why he wants MJ dead so bad is beyond me Because MJ overheard his plans Nah Joe Pescis character ranted that he wanted people to know it is he who is supplying drugs etc so i dunno maybe he just hates MJs musicbr br Lots of cool things in this like MJ turning into a car and a robot and the whole Speed Demon sequence Also the director must have had the patience of a saint when it came to filming the kiddy Bad sequence as usually directors hate working with one kid let alone a whole bunch of them performing a complex dance scenebr br Bottom line this movie is for people who like MJ on one level or another which i think is most people If not then stay away It does try and give off a wholesome message and ironically MJs bestest buddy in this movie is a girl Michael Jackson is truly one of the most talented people ever to grace this planet but is he guilty Well with all the attention ive gave this subjecthmmm well i dont know because people can be different behind closed doors i know this for a fact He is either an extremely nice but stupid guy or one of the most sickest

anything except their desire to appear Cultured Either as a representation of Wagners swansong or as a movie this strikes me as an unmitigated disaster with a leaden reading of the score matched to a tricksy lugubrious realisation of the textbr br Its questionable that people with ideas as to what an opera or for that matter a play especially one by Shakespeare is about should be allowed anywhere near a theatre or film studio Syberberg very fashionably but without the smallest justification from Wagners text decided that Parsifal is about bisexual integration so that the title character in the latter stages transmutes into a kind of beatnik babe though one who continues to sing high tenor  few if any of the actors in the film are the singers and we get a double dose of Armin Jordan the conductor who is seen as the face but not heard as the voice of Amfortas and also appears monstrously in double exposure as a kind of Batonzilla or Conductor Who Ate Monsalvat during the playing of the Good Friday music  in which by the way the transcendant loveliness of nature is represented by a scattering of shopworn and flaccid crocuses stuck in illlaid turf an expedient which baffles me In the theatre we sometimes have to piece out such imperfections with our thoughts but I cant think why Syberberg couldnt splice in for Parsifal and Gurnemanz mountain pasture as lush as was provided for Julie Andrews in Sound of Musicbr br The sound is hard to endure the high voices and the trumpets in particular possessing an aural glare that adds another sort of fatigue to our impatience with the uninspired conducting and paralytic unfolding of the ritual Someone in another review mentioned the 1951 Bayreuth recording and Knappertsbusch though his tempi are often very slow had what Jordan altogether lacks a sense of pulse a feeling for the ebb and flow of the music  and after half a century the orchestral sound in that set in modern pressings is still superior to this film</td>\n","

dialogs and gratuitous nudity Bo and Ingrid are two orphaned siblings with an unusually close and even slightly perverted relationship Can you imagine playfully ripping off the towel that covers your

they fled from Russia with their parents but nasty soldiers brutally slaughtered mommy and daddy A friendly smuggler took custody over them however and even raised and trained Bo and Ingrid into expert smugglers When the actual plot lifts off 20 years later theyre facing their ultimate quest as the mythical and incredibly valuable White Fire diamond is coincidentally found in a mine Very few things in life ever made as little sense as the plot and narrative structure of White Fire but it sure is a lot of fun to watch Most of the time you have no clue whos beating up who or for what cause and I bet the actors understood even less but whatever The violence is magnificently grotesque and every single plot twist is pleasingly retarded The script goes totally bonkers beyond repair when suddenly  and I wont reveal for what reason  Bo needs a replacement for Ingrid and Fred Williamson enters the scene with a big cigar in his mouth and his sleazy black fingers all over the local

extreme poverty portrayed here And if poverty receded in Spain it was not exactly with the sort of socialism that Buñuel favored but with Western European style capitalism But one of the most shocking things about the movie is this in one scene the narrator chides that in school children are taught the value of Pi Teaching math to poor people the horror Buñuel shortsightedness is at its most glaring here not realizing that it is access to the latest knowledge and technology what will help the poor overcome their situation What is he proposing That children are taught exactly what at

           with all this stuff going down at the moment with mj ive started listening to his music watching the odd documentary here and there watched the wiz and watched moonwalker again maybe i just want to get a certain insight into this guy who i thought was really cool in the eighties just to maybe make up my mind whether he is guilty or innocent moonwalker is part biography part feature film which i remember going to see at the cinema when it was originally released some of it has subtle messages about mjs feeling towards the press and also the obvious message of drugs are bad mkaybr br visually impressive but of course this is all about michael jackson so unless you remotely like mj in anyway then you are going to hate this and find it boring some may call mj an egotist for consenting to the making of this movie but mj and most of his fans would say that he made it for the fans which if true is really nice of himbr br the actual feature film bit when it finally starts is only on for 20 minutes or so excluding the smooth criminal sequence and joe pesci is convincing as a psychopathic all powerful drug lord why he wants mj dead so bad is beyond me because mj overheard his plans nah joe pescis character ranted that he wanted people to know it is he who is supplying drugs etc so i dunno maybe he just hates mjs musicbr br lots of cool things in this like mj turning into a car and a robot and the whole speed demon sequence also the director must have had the patience of a saint when it came to filming the kiddy bad sequence as usually directors hate working with one kid let alone a whole bunch of them performing a complex dance scenebr br bottom line this movie is for people who like mj on one level or another which i think is most people if not then stay away it does try and give off a wholesome message and ironically mjs bestest buddy in this movie is a girl michael jackson is truly one of the most talented people ever to grace this planet but is he guilty well with all the attention ive gave this subjecthmmm well i dont know because people can be different behind closed doors i know this for a fact he is either an extremely nice but stupid guy or one of the most sickest liars i hope he is not the latter  \n","1

entertaining film that obviously goes to great effort and lengths to faithfully recreate h g wells classic book mr hines succeeds in doing so i and those who watched his film with me appreciated the fact that it was not the standard predictable hollywood fare that comes out every year eg the spielberg version with tom cruise that had only the slightest resemblance to the book obviously everyone looks for different things in a movie those who envision themselves as amateur critics look only to criticize everything they can others rate a movie on more important baseslike being entertained which is why most people never agree with the critics we enjoyed the effort mr hines put into being faithful to hg wells classic novel and we found it to be very entertaining this made it easy to overlook what the critics perceive to be its shortcomings  \n","2      the film starts with a manager nicholas bell giving welcome investors robert carradine to primal park  a secret project mutating

goods with lots of blood and gore as beheading hairraising chillsfull of scares when the sabretooths appear with mediocre special effectsthe story provides exciting and stirring entertainment but it results to be quite boring the giant animals are majority made by computer generator and seem totally lousy middling performances though the players reacting appropriately to becoming foodactors give vigorously physical performances dodging the beasts runningbound and leaps or dangling over walls  and it packs a ridiculous final deadly scene no for small kids by realisticgory and violent attack

ever didnt i read somewhere either dont care for opera dont care for wagner or dont care about anything except their desire to appear cultured either as a representation of wagners swansong or as a movie this strikes me as an unmitigated disaster with a leaden reading of the score matched to a tricksy lugubrious realisation of the textbr br its questionable that people with ideas as to what an opera or for that matter a play especially one by shakespeare is about should be allowed anywhere near a theatre or film studio syberberg very fashionably but without the smallest justification from wagners text decided that parsifal is about bisexual integration so that the title character in the latter stages transmutes into a kind of beatnik babe though one who continues to sing high tenor  few if any of the actors in the film are the singers and we get a double dose of armin jordan the conductor who is seen as the face but not heard as the voice of amfortas and also appears monstrously in double exposure as a kind of batonzilla or conductor who ate monsalvat during the playing of the good friday music  in which by the way the transcendant loveliness of nature is represented by a scattering of shopworn and flaccid crocuses stuck in illlaid turf an expedient which baffles me in the theatre we sometimes have to piece out such imperfections with our thoughts but i cant think why syberberg couldnt splice in for parsifal and gurnemanz mountain pasture as lush as was provided for julie andrews in sound of musicbr br the sound is hard to endure the high voices and the trumpets in particular possessing an aural glare that adds another sort of fatigue to our impatience with the uninspired conducting and paralytic unfolding of the ritual someone in another review mentioned the 1951 bayreuth recording and knappertsbusch though his tempi are often very slow had what jordan altogether lacks a sense of pulse a feeling for the ebb and flow of the music  and after half a century the orchestral sound in that set in modern pressings is still superior to this film  \n","4

sequences somewhat give the false impression that were dealing with a serious and harrowing drama but you need not fear because barely ten minutes later were up until our necks in nonsensical chainsaw battles rough fistfights lurid dialogs and gratuitous nudity bo and ingrid are two orphaned siblings with an unusually close and even slightly perverted relationship can you imagine playfully ripping off the towel that covers your sisters naked body and then stare at her unshaven genitals for several whole minutes well bo does that to his sister and judging by her dubbed laughter she doesnt mind at all sick dude anyway as kids they fled from russia with their parents but nasty soldiers brutally slaughtered mommy and daddy a friendly smuggler took custody over them however and even raised and trained bo and ingrid into expert smugglers when the actual plot lifts off 20 years later theyre facing their ultimate quest as the mythical and incredibly valuable white fire diamond is coincidentally found in a mine very few things in life ever made as little sense as the plot and narrative structure of white fire but it sure is a lot of fun to watch most of the time you have no clue whos beating up who or for what cause and i bet the actors understood even less but whatever the violence is magnificently grotesque and every single plot twist is pleasingly retarded the script goes totally bonkers beyond repair when suddenly  and i wont reveal for what reason  bo needs a replacement for ingrid and fred williamson enters the scene with a big cigar in his mouth and his sleazy black fingers all over the local prostitutes bos principal opponent is an italian chick with big breasts but a hideous accent the preposterous but catchy theme song plays at least a dozen times throughout the film theres the obligatory werefallinginlove montage and loads of other attractions my god what a brilliant experience the original french title translates itself as life to survive

no need for a sequel certainly not after a television series that was already a sequel to the first film this film feels like a soapopera the writing is so bad its utterly simple the jokes dont come across the acting is flat its shot like a soap it lacks any direction the first film had a good emotional spine behind it every character had a little arc it was very simple then but somehow it worked and i could see the merit of that film but this time around there is no cohesive storyline the characters are dull stereotypes and nothing interesting happens one good thing the brazilian boy who plays axel daeseleires son is pretty well cast that was their one moment of creative success on this film i hear they already shot a second television series as a sequel to team spirit 2 but please god dont let them make a third feature installment  \n","24997

regions is in my opinion one of his weakest films first lets admit that 70 years later spain is much richer than it was then and when i say this i fully admit that wealth can bring problems of its own like excessive individualism and consumerism though all in all wealth its a far better condition than the extreme poverty portrayed here and if poverty receded in spain it was not exactly with the sort of socialism that buñuel favored but with western european style capitalism but one of the most shocking things about the movie is this in one scene the narrator chides that in school children are taught the value of pi teaching math to poor people the horror buñuel shortsightedness is at its most glaring here not realizing that it is access to the latest knowledge and technology what will help the poor overcome their situation what is he proposing that children are taught exactly what at school doesnt buñuel understand that it is the lack of modern technology that has made them poor in

ending i grew up on many great anime movies and this was one of my favourites because it was so unusual  a story about unfairness and cruelty and loneliness and life and choices that cant be undone and the need for others chirin is made alone when the wolf kills his mother but the wolf is alone too when chirin follows him into the mountain the wolf doesnt kill the lamb even though each night he says maybe ill eat you tomorrow the tape of it i have is broken and degraded from age and use i will repair it and watch the movie again someday and cry just as hard as i did as a child stories like this with this depth and feeling and this intricacy of meaning are very rare it is a sad story but ive never encountered any catharsis more beautifully made i am glad i have seen this movie and im glad i saw it as a child  \n","\n","[24904 rows x 2 columns]"],"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-90723290-c94c-436a-ada7-4e97e521ea11\" class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <div>\n","<style

going down at the moment with mj ive started listening to his music watching the odd documentary here and there watched the wiz and watched moonwalker again maybe i just want to get a certain insight into this guy who i thought was really cool in the eighties just to maybe make up my mind whether he is guilty or innocent moonwalker is part biography part feature film which i remember going to see at the cinema when it was originally released some of it has subtle messages about mjs feeling towards the press and also the obvious message of drugs are bad mkaybr br visually impressive but of course this is all about michael jackson so unless you remotely like mj in anyway then you are going to hate this and find it boring some may call mj an egotist for consenting to the making of this movie but mj and most of his fans would say that he made it for the fans which if true is really nice of himbr br the actual feature film bit when it finally starts is only on for 20 minutes or so excluding the smooth criminal sequence and joe pesci is convincing as a psychopathic all powerful drug lord why he wants mj dead so bad is beyond me because mj overheard his plans nah joe pescis character ranted that he wanted people to know it is he who is supplying drugs etc so i dunno maybe he just hates mjs musicbr br lots of cool things in this like mj turning into a car and a robot and the whole speed demon sequence also the director must have had the patience of a saint when it came to filming the kiddy bad sequence as usually directors hate working with one kid let alone a whole bunch of them performing a complex dance scenebr br bottom line this movie is for people who like mj on one level or another which i think is most people if not then stay away it does try and give off a wholesome message and ironically mjs bestest buddy in this movie is a girl michael jackson is truly one of the most talented people ever to grace this planet but is he guilty well with all the attention ive gave this subjecthmmm well i dont know because people can be different behind closed doors i know this for a fact he is either an extremely nice but stupid guy or one of the most sickest

tricksy lugubrious realisation of the textbr br its questionable that people with ideas as to what an opera or for that matter a play especially one by shakespeare is about should be allowed anywhere near a theatre or film studio syberberg very fashionably but without the smallest justification from wagners text decided that parsifal is about bisexual integration so that the title character in the latter stages transmutes into a kind of beatnik babe though one who continues to sing high tenor  few if any of the actors in the film are the singers and we get a double dose of armin jordan the conductor who is seen as the face but not heard as the voice of amfortas and also appears monstrously in double exposure as a kind of batonzilla or conductor who ate monsalvat during the playing of the good friday music  in which by the way the transcendant loveliness of nature is represented by a scattering of shopworn and flaccid crocuses stuck in illlaid turf an expedient which baffles me in the theatre we sometimes have to piece out such imperfections with our thoughts but i cant think why syberberg couldnt splice in for parsifal and gurnemanz mountain pasture as lush as was provided for julie andrews in sound of musicbr br the sound is hard to endure the high voices and the trumpets in particular possessing an aural glare that adds another sort of fatigue to our impatience with the uninspired conducting and paralytic unfolding of the ritual someone in another review mentioned the 1951 bayreuth recording and knappertsbusch though his tempi are often very slow had what jordan altogether lacks a sense of pulse a feeling for the ebb and flow of the music  and after half a century the orchestral sound in that set in modern pressings is still superior to this film</td>\n","

extreme poverty portrayed here and if poverty receded in spain it was not exactly with the sort of socialism that buñuel favored but with western european style capitalism but one of the most shocking things about the movie is this in one scene the narrator chides that in school children are taught the value of pi teaching math to poor people the horror buñuel shortsightedness is at its most glaring here not realizing that it is access to the latest knowledge and technology what will help the poor overcome their situation what is he proposing that children are taught exactly what at
